# GUINiti

This is an GUI that shows the manipulation with the numbers.

The GUI has central text area which is used for writing.

The original values of the numbers are 1, and 1. The fnumber to the left is the square root of the right one.
South panel is the one who has the manipulation over the values, it determines the value of the left number
(which is multiplied by itself and the result is written on the right), and determines by which number the left number will be increased on to the second multiplication.
Once the multiplication is done, the second row is written.

The radio buttons to the left determine the milliseconds of thread sleep

The buttons to the top determine weather the thread will go, stop, or start all-over.

This project can also be done to write all the names, or data from different kind of tables from the SQL server. More to come :)...

Tell me what you think of it... :)
